# KnockoutJsBubbleTea (2013)
A small sample code made in 2013 using C# and KnockoutJS


Further possible improvements
            
   - Need validation (eg. is flavor selected, topping)
   - Further improve layout for mobile viewing
   - Product and CarItem have flavor and topping redundant
   - DataController convert to WebAPI
   - Seperate project for data layers and biz logic (but fine for this small solution)
   - Error handling
   - Unit testing
   - Use real database
   - Improve load performance of products data (compression, combine AJAX JSON requests)
